# rust-wgpu-2D-shapes
My first usage of wgpu with Rust, based on videos 1-5 of https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_UrKDEhALdJS0VrLPn7dqC5A4W1vCAUT

# Updates
1. Started following the incredibly difficult-to-understand Dr. Xu's guide up to video 3
1. Encountered errors ([eg1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18004993/how-to-determine-cause-of-directx-11-driver-hang), [eg2](https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/703795-dxr-and-device-hung-error/))
1. I have no clue what the error (or thread comments) mean, so I'm trying [a different tutorial](https://github.com/peerhenry/rust_hello_triangle)
